Major Projects

* Efficient clustering and spectral library search under large data scale
  * AUG. 2021 - JUL. 2023
  * Supported by: awards from NSF 2117640, U.S. Department of Energy DE-SC0021340
  * Supervisor: Dr. Hosein Mohimani
  * Keywords: C++, Rust, Algorithms, Data mining, Software Engineering, Biostatistics
  * Details:
    * One of the main contributors for designing and implementing MASST+ & Networking+, two toolkits for large-scale spectral library clustering, searching and analysis thatâ€™s three orders of magnitudes faster than the state of art
    * Our contribution greatly improves the efficiency of natural product discoveries and genome mining
    * Paper accepted by Nature Biotechnology as co-first author


* Learning A-domain substrate specificities using AdenPredictor
  * DEC. 2021 - OCT. 2022
  * Supported by: NSF award 2117640
  * Supervisor: Dr. Hosein Mohimani
  * Keywords: Python, Machine Learning, Bioinformatics

  * Details:
    * Participated in the development of HighMMT, a model capable of handling over 8 modalities including spoken language, video, gestures, text and robot sensory data through few-shot modality transfer
    * Improved the tradeoff between performance and parameter-efficiency over existing state-of-art models
  


* DynPartition
  * FEB. - MAY 2022
  * Computer Science Department, CMU
  * Supervisor: Prof. Philip Gibbons
  * Keywords: Python, Distributed Machine Learning, Distributed Systems
  * Details:
    * Proposed and implemented a novel rein-forcement learning-based scheduler that performs dynamic partitioning of computation workload across multiple heterogeneous GPUs for large neural network inference tasks
    * explored an important area of research in distributed machine learning under Cloud Cluster settings



* Distributed Bitcoin Miner
  * AUG. - OCT. 2020
  * Computer Science Department, CMU
  * Supervisor: Dr. Heather Miller
  * Keywords: Golang, Distributed Systems, Networking
  * Details:
    * Designed a mock distributed bitcoin miner based on Remote Procedural Calls (RPC) between client-server interactions
